# BarcodeBot

This was inspired by my original barcode project which can be found [here](https://github.com/AmritHariharan/FilmBarcode2)). The idea is for this to work was a twitter bot, where people tweet youtube links at it, it downloads and processes the video, and tweets the generated barcode back at them.

## Requirements

```
# Set up virtualenv (optional)
$ python -m virtualenv VENV_NAME

# Activate virtualenv
$ source VENV_NAME/bin/activate

# Install packages
$ pip3 install opencv-python pytube validators tweepy
```

## Todo:
- [x] Get barcode generation working
- [x] Add youtube-dl functionality
- [x] Integrate twitter
- [x] Fix downloading, pytube doesn't seem to like my options
- [ ] Fix  naming scheme, seems to be breaking the program if the filename has a `.` in it
- [ ] Put in a Docker container #webscale (?)
- [ ] Get it hosted on AWS/Google Cloud/Azure(???)
