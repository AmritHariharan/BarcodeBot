# BarcodeBot

This was inspired by my original barcode project (which can be found [here](https://github.com/AmritHariharan/FilmBarcode2)). The idea is for this to work was a twitter bot, where people tweet youtube links at it, it downloads and processes the video, and tweets the generated barcode back at them.

## Setup

``` bash
# Using pipenv
pipenv install --python 3.7 -r requirements.txt

# Start the app
pipenv run python app.py
```

## Todo:
- [ ] Fix naming scheme, seems to be breaking the program if the filename has a `.` in it
- [ ] Turn this into a microservice
- [ ] Put in a Docker container #webscale (?)
- [ ] Get it hosted on AWS/Google Cloud/Azure(???)
