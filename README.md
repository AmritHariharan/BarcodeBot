# BarcodeBot

This was inspired by my original barcode project which can be found [here](https://github.com/AmritHariharan/FilmBarcode2)). The idea is for this to work was a twitter bot, where people tweet youtube links at it, it downloads and processes the video, and tweets the generated barcode back at them.
